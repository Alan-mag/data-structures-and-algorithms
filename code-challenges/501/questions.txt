1. Reverse an array. Don’t use a built-in reverse function.
  - Got a working version? Can you develop 2 or 3 different algorithms?

2. Delete duplicates from an array of integers.
  - Got a working version? Can you develop 2 or 3 different algorithms? Consider trading time for space. What if extra space is not allowed?

3. Implement merge sort.

4. Sum 3: Given an array of distinct integers, find a triplet (set of 3 numbers) that sums to zero.
  - Got a working merge sort? Now look for how you might optimize the merge algorithm. Pick a use-case, and see if you can speed it up a bit.

5. Add a kth last function to return the value k elements away from the end of a linked list

6. Add a reverse function. The last element should now be the head, and vice versa.

7. Add a partition function that separates even and odd values within the linked list.
  - Generalize your partition function to take a predicate, to allow partitioning on whatever logic is passed in. E.g., positive / negative, even / odd, greater than / less than some value, etc.

8. Working with time series data - Find the span of a stock price:

9. Given a singly linked list, where each node’s value is a single character, determine if the whole list is a palindrome. How might a stack help you?
  - Can you work out an algorithm to check if a SLL is a palindrome that is O(n) time, and O(1) space?

10. Get your hash working.
- Import the /usr/share/dict/words into your file, and set the words into your hash (with words as keys, their lengths as values).
- Then get them all out again.
- Benchmark individually the get and set blocks, and see what you can do to tweak performance.
- Take note of what your first timing is, and see how much you can improve it by!
  -Find where you can improve the performance of your HashTable.

11. Sum-3: Given an array of distinct integers, find a triplet (set of 3 numbers) that sums to zero. 
    You should be able to do better than O(n^2 * lg n) time and no worse than O(n) space. How might a HashTable or Set help you?

12. Convert your Binary Tree to a BST. Implement at least these methods:
- add compares values, and inserts to the proper sub-tree.
- find(value) searches the BST for a given value, and executes a callback with the value when found.

13. Verify a BST: Write a function that takes a root node as an argument, and returns true only if the tree is a BST.

14. Tree Reconstruction: You are given an array of values that were the result of an in-order traversal on a balanced binary search tree. 
    Write a function that takes in that array as an argument and reconstructs a tree that would’ve given you those values in that order.
      - Do you have benchmarking on your HashTable’s get and set methods? What happens to performance if you use a BST as a collision resolution mechanism, instead of a LinkedList?

15. Implement a solution to the 0-1 Knapsack problem. Cite your sources.

16. Utilize the Trie code from lecture to build an autocomplete tool.

17. Now, implement your own heap.

18. Complete your code for solving a maze (represented as an adjacency list).

19. Given a graph of degree D, find a way to color it so no two connected nodes are colored with the same color. 
    Use no more than D+1 colors. Starter code below! (source: Interview Cake)
